Just a quick post in case you haven't seen it already - we're trying to get a "Network Engineering" site going over at StackExchange. If you're interested, please commit to it by following [**this link**](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/52519/network-engineering?referrer=5RcR3zY3T9eGFjXXhw75VA2).

Thank you!
