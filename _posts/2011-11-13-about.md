## Original (November 2011):

**2015 Update:** See [**this page**](/update/ "About Me – Update") to find out what I've been up to over the years since this entry was originally posted.

I have received a few e-mails from readers asking me questions about myself and what I do, so I thought I'd write a blog entry about it.

I'm a 27 year old Cisco network engineer living in Australia. I work for a large, multinational company, and have been with them for about seven months now and am thoroughly enjoying myself.

I'm currently studying for the CCNP certification, and once completed, I plan to start studying for the CCIE R&S certification.

In my spare time, when I'm not studying or blogging on here, you can usually find me helping out on [**internet forums**](/get-involved-fourms/ "Get Involved – Fourms"). The one I most frequently visit would be the Whirlpool forums where I post under the name [**OzNetNerd**](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/user/85305?days=120).

Speaking of which, a Whirlpool thread that I started quite some time ago may come in use for some of you who are studying for Cisco certifications. For those of you who are only interested in the links and not the users' posts inbetween, I also created a wiki version of the thread.

When I'm not talking Cisco, I'm either playing with custom firmwares, Linux or some other geeky activity. I have put together a brief list of my extra curricular activities below. If you have any questions or need any assistance with anything I have mentioned, please feel free to pop me an e-mail and I'll do all I can to assist.

*   Using [**WDLX TV-Live**](http://wiki.wdlxtv.com/Main_Page) custom firmware for the [**Western Digital TV Live**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WD_TV_Live). For more information, please see my [**Whirlpool thread**](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1759007) about it.
*   Using custom router firmwares, such as [**Gargoyle**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle_%28router_firmware%29), [**DD-WRT**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd-wrt), [**Open-WRT**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_wrt), and [**Tomato**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_firmware) for my home wireless network & wireless bridges.
*   Using  [**Cacti**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacti_%28software%29) for network monitoring.

*   Using  [**AxCrypt**](http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/AxCrypt&ei=LWO_Tt_pCoGiiAf7iqGdBQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3Daxcrypt%2Bwikipedia%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D537%26prmd%3Dimvns) and [**TrueCrypt**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt) for encryption.

*   For a list of tools that I find come in handy, please see my [**"Tools Every Admin/Engineer Needs"**](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1790265) Whirlpool thread.

And finally, when my free time clears up, my next couple of projects will be:

A new website that will assist Cisco newcomers to get through the basics and gradually bring them all the way up to dealing with large, complex networks. The first phase of the site has been completed, however, due to my CCNP studies, I have decided to put the site on the back burner for now.

I also plan to create a new Network Security blog. I have always had an interest in Network Security and after having read Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About it (as suggested by the bloggers on Network World), my interest has increased greatly.

If anyone has any further questions, please feel free to drop me an e-mail or make a comment on this entry and I'll happily respond.

**Update:** Below are a couple of photos of my home lab.
