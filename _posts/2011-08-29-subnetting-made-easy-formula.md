I covered subnetting in my earlier posts, [**Subnetting Made Easy, Part 1**](/subnetting-made-easy-part-1/ "Subnetting Made Easy, Part 1") and [**Subnetting Made Easy, Part 2**](/subnetting-made-easy-part-2/ "Subnetting Made Easy, Part 2").

In the latter mentioned post, I explained how you can use simple additions or subtractions to work out the First Usable Address, the Last Usable Address and the Broadcast Address of a subnet.

As the post was quite long, I thought I should re post the formulas in case they got lost in the sea of text.

Here they are:

*   **First Address** = Network Address + 1
*   **Broadcast Address** = Next Network Address - 1
*   **Last Address** = Broadcast Address - 1

If they make no sense to you, please re-read my previous posts for more information.
