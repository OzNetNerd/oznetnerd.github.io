[**As per my previous post**](/download-install-nexus-1000v-free/ "Download & Install Nexus 1000v For Free!"), I have been in the market for a new PC for a little while now and have finally made a purchase. The specs can be found below.

* **CPU:** Intel Core i7 3770  
* **GPU:** Sapphire Radeon HD7850 2GB OC V2  
* **Mobo:** ASRock Z77 Extreme6 Motherboard  
* **RAM:** G.Skill Ares F3-1600C10D-16GAO 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3  
* **Case:** CoolerMaster HAF 912 Advanced  
* **PSU:** Antec High Current Gamer 520W Power Supply HCG-520  
* **HDD1:** Samsung 830 Series 128GB SSD  
* **HDD2:** Samsung 830 Series 128GB SSD  
* **HDD3:** Seagate Barracuda 2TB ST2000DM001  
* **ODD:** Samsung SH-224BB/BEBS SATA DVDRW Drive OEM  
* **Screen:** 27" Acer V273HL Acer V273HL FHD LED Backlight Monitor

The reason for I opted for the Intel Core i7 3770 instead of the 3770K (as was originally planned) is due to the 3770's VT-d support. It was a difficult giving up the overclocking capabilities provided by the 3770K, however, as virtualisation is one of my primary goals I knew which way I had to go.

In regards to the GPU, I like to game from time to time so thought I'd treat myself with a half decent graphics card.

In regards to the two SSDs - as I plan to use several VMs concurrently, I didn't want my HDD to become a bottleneck. By having two SSDs I will be able to spread my VMs across both of them.

In regards to the 16gb of RAM, I thought I'd give it a try to see how well it performs but will most end up purchasing another 16gb as virtual machines tend to consume a heck of a lot of RAM.

Anyway, now that I have my new machine, it is time to get started [**adding a Nexus**](/download-install-nexus-1000v-free/ "Download & Install Nexus 1000v For Free!") to my lab!
