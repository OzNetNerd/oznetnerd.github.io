In the [**Connecting Your PC to Your Virtual GNS3 Routers**](/connecting-pc-virtual-gns3-routers/ "Connecting Your PC to Your Virtual GNS3 Routers") post I provided basic instructions explaining how you can connect your PC to your [**GNS3**](/tags/#GNS3) topology, allowing you to connect to the virtual routers as if they were real physical routers.

Next, in my [**Virtual Equipment + Physical Equipment = Big Lab**](/virtual-equipment-physical-equipment-big-lab/ "Virtual Equipment + Physical Equipment = Big Lab") post I expanded on the above idea and explained how you can connect physical and virtual machines to your GNS3 routers, as well as physical network gear too.

However, after having re-read the above two posts I felt that they may not be clear enough for those who are not familiar with GNS3 and/or virtualisation. With this in mind I decided to create a brand new website that would explain every single step of the process in great detail. A few months have past since then but it is now with great pleasure I would like to announce that it has finally been completed! Please follow the link below to get started.
