What better way to start the **[Zero to Hero Guide](/netapp-zero-to-hero-introduction/)** than learning how to build your own ONTAP lab for free? Thanks to Neil Anderson over at [**FlackBox**](http://www.flackbox.com), we can do just that!

Neil has written a book which covers the entire end to end process. The book contains easy to follow step by step instructions, screenshots and diagrams to ensure that nothing gets missed. Heck, he even provides the IP addresses! The beauty of this is that even if you have zero NetApp experience, you'll still be able to get a fully operational lab up and running in no time at all.

Anyway, without further ado, here's where you can find [**Neil's guide**](http://www.flackbox.com/netapp-simulator/).

If you run into any issues with your build, be sure to reach out to Neil and he will be more than happy to help you out.
