When you install Python on Windows, you may find that you cannot access it and/or pip from anywhere on the commandline. For example, you find that you need to navigate to C:\\Python27\\ScriptsÂ in order to use pip. To enable access to them from anywhere on the commandline, issue the following commands:

```
setx path "%path%;C:\\Python27;"
setx path "%path%;C:\\Python27\\Scripts;"
```
