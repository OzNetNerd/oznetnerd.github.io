Hello and welcome to my blog.

I know what you are thinking, "not another Cisco Blog!", but this one will be different, I promise :)

The point of this blog is to patch up the holes that other blogs/websites leave in the information that they provide. While researching topics in the past, I have found on more than a few occasions that some sites fail to fully explain what it is they are talking about (whether it be a protocol, QoS, troubleshooting, etc) and by the end of it I am left scratching my head and feeling like I know less than I did before I found the site.

So with this in mind I am going to explain each topic I discuss in great detail to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen to my readers. Having said that though, I do not plan to re-invent the wheel. If there is a great resource out there that will assist me in explaining a topic, I will gladly link to it and perhaps expand on it if need be.

In addition to writing, I will also use real labs to further help me explain the subjects that I cover, and I will also include screenshots, packet captures and running-configs to further explain how the whole thing came together.

Anyway, that's all for now folks! Stay tuned and I hope you enjoy your stay!!
